"IV","I","BENEDICK","I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?"
"IV","I","BEATRICE","As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you; but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin."
"IV","I","BENEDICK","By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me."
"IV","I","BEATRICE","Do not swear by it, and eat it."
"IV","I","BENEDICK","I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it that says I love not you."
"IV","I","BEATRICE","Will you not eat your word?"
"IV","I","BENEDICK","With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee."
"IV","I","BEATRICE","Why then, God forgive me!"
"IV","I","BENEDICK","What offence, sweet Beatrice?"
"IV","I","BEATRICE","You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you."
"IV","I","BENEDICK","And do it with all thy heart."
"IV","I","BEATRICE","I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest."
