lp_eu:1999-07-20-Speech-2-002 lpv:spokenText "Mr President, I should like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the House. I want to register my protest at the lack of facilities for me, as a Deputy within this Chamber. Two and a half years ago, I went to the authorities who were dealing with the building of this new structure and informed them of my requirements as a person with a disability within the Chamber. I was assured at that stage that every facility would be made available. I arrived here last month and spoke with the architects and builders with regard to the seating arrangements within the hemicycle. I also wrote a letter to the former President, informing him of the difficulties that would arise.\nI arrived here today, after being re-elected to this Parliament, to discover, firstly, that I cannot get from the ‘0’ level of the building to the first level without getting a security card from one of the security services. I was delayed for 24 minutes this morning and 38 minutes last night waiting for someone to come along with a card.\nSecondly, I cannot sit with my political group within this House because there are no facilities for me to sit with them. Thirdly, it is an absolute disgrace when so much public money has been spent on this new building that we could not give a proper example for the 21st century – for the new millennium – of what kind of an inclusive society the European Parliament wants to see in the future.\n(Loud and sustained applause )\nI should like to finish with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: ‘To hate your fellow man is not the ultimate sin but to be apathetic towards him, that is the essence of inhumanity’. We have seen it here today. I want to register this protest. I will be taking part in the proceedings. But I want my heartfelt objections to be heard by everybody within this Chamber and around Europe when it is being televised today.\n(Loud and sustained applause )"@en .

I can assure you, as I am being assured at this moment, that the services will carry out the necessary technical alterations you have requested in time for the September part-session. I am sure that the President-elect will personally ensure that this undertaking is made good within the deadline."@en .

lp_eu:1999-07-20-Speech-2-004 lpv:translatedText "I would like to announce that, pursuant to Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the duties of oldest Member should fall to Mário Soares. However, he considered it appropriate not to carry out these duties as he is standing for President of the Parliament. Under these circumstances, the duties fall to myself.\nLadies and gentlemen, I will be brief. It is not the first time that I have had to perform the duties of President of a Parliamentary Assembly, but it is the first time that this has been in the capacity of oldest Member, even standing in for an illustrious, older colleague, and I cannot disguise a certain feeling of embarrassment. I am, nevertheless, very grateful for the opportunity that this occasion affords me to welcome each of you very warmly to this Assembly, of which I have had the honour of being a Member for several years now, although most of my experience comes from my many years as a Member of the national parliament of my country, Italy. I believe strongly in the parliamentary institution, and I am especially convinced that the democratic legitimisation of the whole of the process of European integration rests on this Parliament, on the full recognition of its role, and also on its ability to collaborate with the national parliaments.\nWe are aware of the fact that our Parliament has acquired wider powers and must acquire more. We must now make a decisive contribution to the reform of the institutions of the Union, to building an authentic European democracy. This is the task which unites us, beyond the substantial political differences which characterise us, and which will certainly be expressed in heated debates. In this hemicycle, our lovely new home, there will be brilliant reasoned debate and there will be competition, but we will never allow ourselves to forget the cause to which great personalities of European life have devoted themselves. Please allow me to mention, of all of them, a man from whom I have personally learned a great deal, calling to mind the ten years of battles he fought in this hemicycle, our beloved Altiero Spinelli.\n(Applause )\nThe cause which unites us, ladies and gentlemen, as we face difficult and exacting challenges, is that of building a more united, wider, stronger Europe, in order to ensure peace, freedom and justice throughout the continent.\nI wish you all every success in your work during the fifth legislative term.\nAs I recall, the Rules of Procedure prohibit any discussion while the oldest Member is in the Chair, which is not strictly related to the procedures for the election of the President or to the verification of his credentials."@en .
